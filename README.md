## üìå About the Project

### What is Forks and Points?
Forks and Points is a multiplayer game where players compete to earn points by completing daily tasks related to healthy eating (**Green Tasks**) and physical activity (**Blue Tasks**). The goal is to accumulate **STAR Points** to win rewards at the end of the month, while avoiding penalties.

### Key Features:
- **Green Points**: Earned by completing healthy eating tasks. Use them to unlock rewards like "Cheat Day" or "Cheat Meal."
- **Blue Points**: Earned by completing physical activity tasks. Use them to re-roll tasks or unlock special actions.
- **STAR Points**: The main competitive metric. Players with the most STAR Points at the end of the month win rewards, while those with fewer than 12 STAR Points face penalties.
- **Rewards and Penalties**: Winners get rewards (e.g., a free meal, a movie night paid by the loser), while losers face fun penalties (e.g., doing the dishes for two weeks).
